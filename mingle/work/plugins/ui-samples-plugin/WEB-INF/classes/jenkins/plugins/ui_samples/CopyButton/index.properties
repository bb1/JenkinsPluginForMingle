blurb=\
  <tt>l.copyButton</tt> tag creates a small button that allows users to paste text into the clipboard. \
  Browsers make it unbelievably hard to do this simple task, so that's why we use a tag to encapsulate it. \
  The tag requires two mandatory attributes. One is <tt>text</tt>, which represents the text to be copied into the clipboard. \
  The other is <tt>message</tt>, which represents a message to be displayed upon the successful copying into the clipboard.

aboutContainerElement=\
  According to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zeroclipboard/wiki/Instructions#Gluing">ZeroClipboard documentation</a>, \
  which is what we use for the copying, it is desirable to have an outer block element that houses a button, to improve \
  the accuracy of positioning a hidden flash movie. This can be specified as a CSS selector in the <tt>container</tt> attribute. \
  Note that you do not need to set the <tt>position:relative</tt> manually, as this tag will automatically set it.
