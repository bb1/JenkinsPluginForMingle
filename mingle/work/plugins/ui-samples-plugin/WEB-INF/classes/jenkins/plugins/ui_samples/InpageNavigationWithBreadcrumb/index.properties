blurb=You can add arbitrary additional items to the breadcrumb bar (see above), and associate menus with them. \
  This mechanism is convenient for adding anchors to a large page and provide quick access to the key parts. \
  A very typical place where you want to do this is in the configuration page. There's a &lt;f:breadcrumb-config-outline> \
  tag specifically for this use case, which parses &lt;f:section>s and use that to build the context menu. \
  See the freestyle job configuration page for an example of using this tag.
