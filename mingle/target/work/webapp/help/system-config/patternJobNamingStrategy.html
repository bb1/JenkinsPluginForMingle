<div>
  Define a pattern (regular expression) to check whether the job name is valid or not. <br>
  Forcing the check on existing jobs, will allow you to enforce a naming convention on existing jobs - e.g. even if the user does not change the name, 
  it will be validated with the given pattern at every submit and no updates can be made until the name confirms.
